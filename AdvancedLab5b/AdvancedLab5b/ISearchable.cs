  Purpose: This interface has one method that classes making use of must
           implement. 

           The class implementing the Search() method will be assumed to
           use a string search key as a parameter and return a boolean
           value to indicate if that key was successfully found.

           This code is not to be altered.

        bool Search(string key);
    }
}
